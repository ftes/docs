A nice first project to get started is a simple [Flask][flask-link] web server, which will serve a static page on port `:80`. All the project source code can be found [here on GitHub][simple-server-python-link]. Download a zipped file of the project from [here][simple-server-python-download], and when downloaded, unzip the file and open a terminal in the root of the project directory.
