A nice first project to get started is a simple [Express.js][expressjs] web server which, will serve a static page on port `:80`. All the project source code can be found [here on GitHub][simple-server-node-link]. Download a zipped file of the project [here][github-download], and when downloaded, unzip the file and open a terminal in the root of the project directory.
