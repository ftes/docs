A nice first project to get started is a simple [Go][go] hello world program, which will print a `Hello, world!` message to the logs on the dashboard. All the project source code can be found [here on GitHub][balena-go-hello-world-link]. Download a zipped file of the project from [here][balena-go-hello-world-download],and when downloaded, unzip the file and open a terminal in the root of the project directory.
